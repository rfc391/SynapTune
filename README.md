# SynapTune-main

This project has been enhanced with DARPA-inspired frameworks and tools.

## Key Enhancements
- XDATA-inspired scalable data processing and analytics using Apache Spark and Kafka.
- Privacy-preserving computation with PySyft and IBM HELib.
- HIVE-inspired real-time graph visualization using Neo4j and D3.js.
- Explainable AI (XAI) with LIME and SHAP for transparent diagnostics.
- Secure AI models with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART).
- IoT device coordination inspired by OFFSET using MQTT and EdgeX Foundry.

## Integrated Frameworks
